# INFO 443 Project 2 Luxon Software 

## About the Luxon Software
<p><strong> 1) What is the software system, and what does it do? Give a short (a few sentences is fine) explanation from a user/consumer perspective. </strong></p>

<p>Luxon is a JavaScript library where it allows software developers to work with dates and times when writing JavaScript code.</p>

<p><strong> 2) Who created the software, and who currently "maintains" it? (Was it developed by a large company or an independent developer? Who seems to be in charge of approving changes to its code/architecture?) </strong></p>

<p>Luxon is maintained and collaborated on by a community of 170 contributors with it being an open source software.</p>
